My name is Hans. The following are phrases about what I like:

- "The beauty of **chess** is it can be whatever you want it to be. It transcends language, age, race, religion, politics, gender and socioeconomic background. Whatever your circumstances, anyone can enjoy a good fight to the death over the chess board". (Simon Williams)
-**Gambeteando**: A South American term which has its origins in the sea. The word means shrimping, relating to fishing boats moving from boat to boat.
-"We need to be in the actual life, the real life, because **capoeira** is fundamentally about the roda of life" (Mestre Gato)
-**Family** and **friends** are the most important things in this life.
-**Fact:** During **StarCraft's** early development, you needed three High Templars to make an Archon. 

What else do you need?
